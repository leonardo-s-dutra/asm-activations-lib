# ASM Activations Lib

An efficient library written in NASM assembly for x86-64 architecture that provides activation functions commonly used in machine learning and neural networks. This library offers high-performance calculations, proper for low-level applications or environments where performance is critical.

## Features

- **Optimized for x86-64 architecture**: Delivers fast activation function computations for x86-64.
- **Core Activation Functions**:
  - Sigmoid (Logistic Function)
  - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
  - Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **NASM assembler**: Can be installed on Linux using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install nasm

- **Make**: Can be installed on Linux using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install make
